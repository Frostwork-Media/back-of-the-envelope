- toggle the code
- make it so that we auto zoom only when number of nodes changes, with delay, and it should run the graph layout algorithm, and then fitZoom...
- Add voice chat so that it can be used more or less on the go
- do a proper ux, again with on the go in mind, code overlay i think
- maybe move it into a realtime situation
- a nicer slider
- including updating existing code in prompt
- what if you rotated each element a tiny bit for a cute effect
- use current screen aspect ratio when running layout


- How are we testing a particular instance of our final distribution, like inputs to our function. There has to be a way. That's more or less the missing piece.

- finally i think we would also look up markets, and find an easy way to integrate those markets (or other API's) into the app. we could enable user API's as well. And allow people to write their own API's connected to their own proprietary data.

And this is "The right version of estimaker" imo

Assuming people can just edit the code.
