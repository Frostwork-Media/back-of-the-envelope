- ~~basically need decent prompt results~~
- ~~I can write a parser which turns the current thing into a graph~~
- ~~run the javascript with the current values~~
- ~~lay things out with dagre~~
- including updating existing code in prompt
- would want to switch to next js and streaming, maybe t3 app
- Add voice chat so that it can be used more or less on the go
- maybe move it into a realtime situation
- a nicer slider



- How are we testing a particular instance of our final distribution, like inputs to our function. There has to be a way. That's more or less the missing piece.

- finally i think we would also look up markets, and find an easy way to integrate those markets (or other API's) into the app. we could enable user API's as well. And allow people to write their own API's connected to their own proprietary data.

And this is "The right version of estimaker" imo

Assuming people can just edit the squiggle.
